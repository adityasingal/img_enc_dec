Images are used in various areas so its security is of great concern nowadays. To focus on the security aspect, we designed a working Python program to Encrypt and Decrypt JPEG/PNG Images symetrically by using Bitmaps, Chaos Theory, Logistic Maps, XOR gates, Numpy, Matplotlib and OpenCV. Chaos theory is a scientific discipline and area of mathematics focusing on the underlying patterns and deterministic principles of extremely sensitive dynamical systems. The logistic map is a degree 2 polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) that is sometimes referenced as a quintessential illustration of how complex, chaotic behavior may evolve from extremely simple non-linear dynamical equations. xn+1=rxn(1+xn)
We also plotted histograms for the original image and the encrypted image.The Histogram gives an estimation of how the pixels are distributed. The histogram thus gives an idea of the randomness of the distribution of the pixel values in the image. It is very difficult to decrypt an image if the randomness of the encrypted image is high.
